## 🧠 Projects Overview

### **1️⃣ Customer Sentiment Analysis**
**Objective:** Analyze customer reviews to determine overall sentiment — positive, negative, or neutral — and identify areas of customer satisfaction or concern.

**Key Tasks:**
- Collected and cleaned raw customer review data.  
- Conducted **sentiment analysis** using the `TextBlob` NLP library.  
- Visualized sentiment distribution using a donut chart.  
- Generated a professional GitHub report summarizing methods and results.

**Tools & Libraries:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, TextBlob  

**Key Insights:**
- Majority of customer feedback was **positive**, showing general satisfaction.  
- Negative reviews were tied to product delays and quality inconsistencies.

### **2️⃣ Sales Trend Analysis**
**Objective:** Identify overall trends, seasonal patterns, and detect significant anomalies in sales data using the Superstore dataset.

**Key Tasks:**
- Processed and aggregated sales data (2014–2017).  
- Conducted **trend and seasonal decomposition** using time-series techniques.  
- Detected anomalies and highlighted high-performing months.  
- Created insightful charts for GitHub visualization.

**Tools & Libraries:** Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels

**Key Insights:**
- Sales showed **steady growth** from 2015 to 2017.  
- Clear **seasonal spikes** in November and December (holiday sales).  
- Detected anomalies aligned with expected holiday peaks — not data errors.
